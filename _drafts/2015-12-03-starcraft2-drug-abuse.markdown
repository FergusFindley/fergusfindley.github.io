As some of you may know, `stared` does not come from `ogling` (or collecting GitHub starts), but from the StarCraft Campaign Editor (I even created a campaign, [for Adun, for Earth](https://stared.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/fAfE_v12.zip)).

While I did enjoy the original StarCraft story (especially 3 races with very different psychology), I couldn't say the same about SC2. Why?

Let's start with Diablo II (as a warm-up) and then we can go into (the void of) SC2.

## Diablo II

It's about violent metal scrappers. They visits abandoned buildings and some other shady places to get metalware. If someone opposes, they beat him/her/it down.
Then they go back to a shop, sell their stuff and buy flasks of booze - so they have power for their further excursions.

## StarCraft II

(**Wings of Liberty**) Jim, an alcoholic, is visited by his old friend, Tychus, who went out of a prison. The ex-convict suggests a plan of stealing some ancient art. Jim want to spend this money on saving his ex-almost-girfriend Sarah from a devastating addiction. Just after doing so Tychus hears voices to kill her.

(**Heart of the Swarm**) Sarah was once left to herself during a bad trip, by Arcturus. Her body is visibly changed by substance abuse ([Krokodil](http://time.com/3398086/the-worlds-deadliest-drug-inside-a-krokodil-cookhouse/)?), and she becomes a self-proclaimed queen of ants.
Briefly freed from her addiction, as Jim goes to jail, she dives into in again and seeks nothing by vengeance on Arcturus.

(**Legacy of the Void**) Artanis, Zeratul and Selendis want to reclaim a meadow from the ants (look at their names, they are not sane even when sober). However, they should have been more careful about choosing shrooms: they become possessed by an evil god.
They side with a homeless and burn her shelter, as it's infested.
They use machines to scorch ants.
They help a mobster (an evil, but the only sane, person) to kill his boss in a duel.
Group self-mutilation, friends killing each other while under influence - seriously, this trip goes horribly wrong!

And the epilogue - Sarah takes a golden shot to meet god and make him pay. Two years later Jim drinks to death.

## Take home message

Drink (and do drugs) responsibly. If you start hearing demonic voices, seek medical help immediately! And never drink with aliens.
