> Need to decide what is the added value wrt data science intro

In the previous post [What I do: Science to Data Science](2015-12-14-sci-to-data-sci)

When giving advice, I often say explicitly *Your Millage May Vary*. So, what was may millage?

## Background

Since I was 5 yo or so, I got interested in science (largely thanks to public educational TV).
I had interest in biology, chemistry[^1], psychology, mathematics and physics. I enjoyed reducing complex patterns to a simple set of rules (and have poor verbal memory), so physics become my love.

During my undergraduate studies (physics and mathematics) I was interested in using reasoning from physics to model other processes (perhaps with the best example of [A mathematical model of the Mafia game](http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1031)). Though, my department was conservative and everything not containing *energy* was considered not worth being called physics (or worth studying). In particular, complex systems (or complex networks) were not studied there.

I was thinking about doing PhD in complex systems, but I lacked experience, contacts and missed practical programming skills (and was too used to the mathematical pen-and-paper approach). I did have a lot of experience with programming, but only scientific - signal analysis, combinatorics, calculus etc (mostly in Mathematica).

At that time I was still convinced that academia is the only place suitable for me, and other jobs offer less freedom, mission or intellectual challenge. So, I ended up doing PhD in quantum optics & information, in which I already had a few publications.

## Main part

It was only during my PhD when I discovered that startup world offers more for the young than academia (they can shape their lives and the world). Moreover, that when it comes to freedom, social innovation and openness software world tends to be ahead of academia. First it was envy - that *my* academia is lagging behind *their* software world. But, step by step, I started shifting by position.

I started learning Python in my second of my PhD studies, for three reasons:

* web scraping conferences for a (failed) startup Confrenzy (a scientific conference aggregator),
* reusing scripts from MathOverflow to parse data from a (failed) questions & answers site [Theoretical Physics - Stack Exchange](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/130361/why-did-theoretical-physics-fail) Q&A group,
* auto-therapy (I felt alienated and craved for feedback).

> skills learnt: Python, IPython Notebook

I attended a few complex systems conferences, but as PhD student I was not much in position to start remote collaborations. I desperately tired to get to [Complex Systems Summer School](http://www.santafe.edu/education/schools/complex-systems-summer-schools/), to no avail[^2].

Later, I learnt about the first edition of [Big Dive](http://www.bigdive.eu/) and applied there.
It was a wonderful, and extremely fruitful, month.

Not much later, I got convinced that I should apply for a data science internship. I focused exclusively on applying to Bay Area. This time also I got rejected for many places, but I at least with a firm conviction it is because of my lack of skills and experience, not - other factors.

I got

(technical interviews; in most places data scientist need to pass bar of a software engineer)

## First clients

After the internship I got convinced that I want to dive in data science. I got an offer to leave PhD, but declined (forfeiting a highly-praised title of a *PhD dropout*).

Finishing my PhD got much longer than expected, and was much more painful.

## Credits

By far the biggest credit goes to Jacek Migdał, my brother. He:


* persuaded me to apply to Bay Area.

* Jacek Migdał (my brother) - for hinting that I should learn Python, for advising me to apply to Bay Area (rather than any other place) and in general for encouraging me to try things outside of academia.
* Adam Zadrożny - for

[^1]: I even had a chemistry lab in my basement!
[^2]: At one conference I was told: *"If you are not a women or minority, you need to have strong personal support to get there"*. I didn't have.
